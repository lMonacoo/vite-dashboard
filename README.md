### Simple Structure

I created a simple structure of folders, and the `domain` folder, which is handle all the business rules or use cases

I will improve the structure, creating more 3 folders:
Presentation -> all visual/ui content (components, assets, styles)
Main -> all the core files or folders (App.tsx, main.tsx, pages folder)
Infra -> the external stuff (libs, mocks)
